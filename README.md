# My Clang Lab
I assume you have (the version I built with) LLVM 9.0.0 - http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#9.0.0

This is a repository to help me keep my C++ skills sharp. 

- To Build/Clean/Run: Open the Python interpreter in the repositories base directory:
- Import the functions-of-interest from the build.py

`>>> from python import build, clean, run`

Then,

`>>> build()`

to build,

`>>> run()`

to run

`>>> clean()`

to clean up.
